## Ressources
To carry out this project,
- I used the MongoBD [More](https://www.mongodb.com/) service in which I created a user with only the role of reading and writing in the calculator_app database.
- I started integrating functionalists like JsonWebToken [More](https://jwt.io/) for  authentication.

## Benefit

This project allowed me to familiarize myself with the Angular ecosystem,
and understand its basic concepts. I will be happy to implement them in future projects.
